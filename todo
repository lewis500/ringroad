put on github
tolls
axes for cumchart
go up to 300 cars
make the sample a percentage
plot the mfd



RESEARCH
- add signals so it becomes a trapezoid. its the simplest spatial structure you can simulate that mimics what happens in real life
- randomness in signals
- different greens and reds and different offsets
- allow to change the number of signals
- when close to one another capacity depends on offsets
- 10x size of the network
- decoupling. ring road is realistic because in a network with signals you can consider one arterial at a time

for the time being
common cycles
you can play with hte offsets
green percentage
number of signals/distance between signals
for critical distance...take the number of vehicles that can exit in one green. space them at jam spacing. that makes the maximum of the mfd lower.
